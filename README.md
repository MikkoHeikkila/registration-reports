## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What permissions are required to use this plugin?

You need the `list_users` capability to access the Registration Reports page. By default, this is available to Administrators and Editors.

### What's the difference between "New Registrations" and "Anniversaries" modes?

- **New Registrations**: Shows users whose actual registration date (year-month-day) falls within your selected date range
- **Anniversaries**: Shows users whose registration month-day falls within the selected range, regardless of year (e.g., all users who registered on December 15th, any year)

### Can I modify user data from the reports?

Yes! In the **Registrations** tab, you can toggle the "Is Frozen" status for any user by clicking on the Yes/No value. In the **Review Inquiries** tab, you can quickly unfreeze users with pending inquiries using the "Unfreeze" button. Both actions use AJAX for instant updates. When a user is frozen, the system automatically records the timestamp. When unfrozen, this timestamp is cleared.

### What timezone are the dates displayed in?

All dates are displayed in your WordPress site's configured timezone. The plugin automatically handles timezone conversion from the stored UTC dates.

### Does this plugin work with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)?

Yes! The plugin requires and integrates with ACF. It uses the following ACF fields:
- `is_frozen`: Boolean field indicating if user is frozen
- `frozen_at`: Timestamp field for when user was frozen
- `review_inquiry`: Boolean field indicating if user has submitted a review inquiry
- `review_inquiry_at`: Timestamp field for when the inquiry was submitted

You'll need to create these fields in ACF for the plugin to function properly.

### What if a user doesn't have a membership number?

The membership number column will simply be empty for users who don't have that meta field set. This won't cause any errors.

### How do Review Inquiries work?

When a frozen user submits a review inquiry, the `review_inquiry` field is set to true and the `review_inquiry_at` timestamp is recorded. These users appear in the **Review Inquiries** tab where administrators can:
- View all users with pending inquiries using the "Show All Inquiries" button
- Filter inquiries by submission date range
- Quickly unfreeze users with the "Unfreeze" button

When a user is unfrozen, you may want to manually clear the `review_inquiry` field to remove them from the inquiries list.

### Can I export the results?

Currently, the plugin displays results in a table format. For export functionality, you would need to use browser-based export or copy the data manually.
