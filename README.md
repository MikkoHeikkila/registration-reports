## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What permissions are required to use this plugin?

You need the `list_users` capability to access the Registration Reports page. By default, this is available to Administrators and Editors.

### What's the difference between "New Registrations" and "Anniversaries" modes?

- **New Registrations**: Shows users whose actual registration date (year-month-day) falls within your selected date range
- **Anniversaries**: Shows users whose registration month-day falls within the selected range, regardless of year (e.g., all users who registered on December 15th, any year)

### Can I modify user data from the reports?

Yes! You can toggle the "Is Frozen" status for any user directly from the results table by clicking on the Yes/No value. This uses AJAX for instant updates without page refresh.

### What timezone are the dates displayed in?

All dates are displayed in your WordPress site's configured timezone. The plugin automatically handles timezone conversion from the stored UTC dates.

### Does this plugin work with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)?

Yes! The plugin displays ACF fields (like the "is_frozen" field) and can work with any user meta fields you have configured.

### What if a user doesn't have a membership number?

The membership number column will simply be empty for users who don't have that meta field set. This won't cause any errors.

### Can I export the results?

Currently, the plugin displays results in a table format. For export functionality, you would need to use browser-based export or copy the data manually.
